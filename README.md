# BertPooled. 
'BertPooled'is a simple project that reduces the computation burden of a BERT by simply addding a pooling layer.  
The concept comes from a basic assumption that if pooling layers actually can function to reduce the size of a matrix without loosing part of its data, could it be equally applicable to BERT to reduce the size of its hidden state while maintaining its performance
